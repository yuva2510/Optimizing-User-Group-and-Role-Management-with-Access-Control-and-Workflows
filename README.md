# Optimizing User, Group, and Role Management with Access Control and Workflows

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a **structured role-based access control system** with well-defined workflows. The goal is to streamline **task management, accountability, and access permissions** within small project teams using ServiceNow.

The system ensures:
- Clear role definitions  
- Proper user and group management  
- Controlled access through ACLs  
- Automated workflows for approvals and task updates

## üë• Team Information
- **Team Leader:** A. Yuvaganesh  
- **Member 1:** B. Anand Raj  
- **Member 2:** G. Sanjay  
- **Member 3:** Nitish Kumar  

---

## üéØ Objective
To create a **role-based access control (RBAC) system** in ServiceNow that enables small teams (e.g., Project Manager and Team Member) to efficiently manage projects, track tasks, and ensure accountability.

---

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
In small project management teams, the absence of clear **role definitions**, **access controls**, and **structured workflows** often leads to confusion in task assignments and progress tracking.  
This project addresses those challenges by providing a structured RBAC-based workflow system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Tools Used
- **ServiceNow** (Users, Groups, Roles, Tables, Workflows)  
- **Oracle DB**  
- **TensorFlow** (for additional enhancements, if required)  

---

## üöÄ Implementation Milestones

### Milestone 1: Users
- Create new users in ServiceNow.  
- Example: `Alice (Project Manager)` and `Bob (Team Member)`.

### Milestone 2: Groups
- Create groups under **System Security**.  
- Example: `Project Team Group`.

### Milestone 3: Roles
- Define roles (e.g., `Project Manager`, `Team Member`).  
- Assign relevant permissions.

### Milestone 4: Tables
- Create required tables such as:
  - `Project Table`
  - `Task Table 2`  
- Enable modules for accessibility.

### Milestone 5: Assign Users to Groups
- Add users (`Alice`, `Bob`) to the project team group.

### Milestone 6: Assign Roles to Users
- Assign `Project Manager` role and table permissions to Alice.  
- Assign `Team Member` role and restricted permissions to Bob.  

### Milestone 7: Application Access
- Configure application modules for tables and assign proper role-based access.

### Milestone 8: Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Define ACLs for table fields like `comments`, `status`, etc.  
- Ensure role-based restricted editing.

### Milestone 9: Workflow (Flow Designer)
- Create automated flows for:
  - Task creation and updates  
  - Approvals from Project Manager  
  - Automatic status updates

## ‚úÖ Outcome
- **Clear accountability** through structured roles  
- **Efficient collaboration** between Project Manager and Team Members  
- **Better project tracking** using tables and workflows  
- **Secure access** with ACLs and role-based restrictions  

 üìñ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **RBAC and workflows in ServiceNow** can optimize project management for small teams. By combining **user, group, role, and ACL configurations**, along with **Flow Designer automation**, the system ensures streamlined execution and improved accountability.
